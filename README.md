# Projects

The purpose of this repository is to showcase a selection of projects and assignments completed during my studies.
These projects represent my early work with various technologies, concepts, and frameworks. While they reflect the starting point of my technical journey, my skills and experience have continued to develop significantly since then.
Some projects include only instructions and reports explaining the implementation and solution.
This repository is intended for future employers and will be updated continuously as I complete my thesis and have more time on hand to further expand my portfolio.
