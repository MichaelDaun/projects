# Embedded Systems Projects

Embedded systems was the focus area of my engineering studies.  
Due to the nature of the coursework, many projects were small and fast-paced, often examined through practical tasks performed in the lab environment. This makes it difficult to fully represent everything we covered through documentation alone.

Most of my practical experience has been with MicroPython and the RP2040 microcontroller, but I also have hands-on experience with other microcontrollers and brands beyond Raspberry Pi.

## Overview of Contents

- **Computer Tech Course**:  
  Basic low-level programming assignments involving interrupts, subroutines, and work in C and ARM assembly.

- **Reliability Course**:  
  An assignment focused on fault tolerance in embedded systems, where I applied a triple modular redundancy (TMR) strategy in practice.

- **RTOS Assignment**:  
  An introduction to the Zephyr real-time operating system (RTOS). This project involved comparing a real-time hardware setup running on an RTOS to a non-RTOS system.  
  In my implementation, the processor performed several trivial tasks that would immediately cease if a flame was detected by a flame sensor, demonstrating the critical role of real-time systems in safety-critical applications.
