# B2 CRUD

Second assignment of Web Development Part 2.

A simple CRUD application for managing code snippets, built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS.

## Getting Started

Everything is pre-configured, including the Docker container for MongoDB, the server setup and .env file.
Running npm start will start both the server and database.

1. **Clone the repository:**

  ``` bash

  git clone git@github.com:MichaelDaun/projects.git
  cd projects/web_dev/b2-crud-main
  ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

  ``` bash
  npm install
  ```

3. **Start the application:**

  ``` bash
  npm start
  ```

This will:  
-	Start the MongoDB container  
-	Launch the Express server  
-	Make the app accessible at http://localhost:3000
