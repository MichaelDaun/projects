# Machine Learning Projects

Machine learning is one of my absolute favorite fields within computer science.  
This directory contains a selection of assignments and projects focused on supervised and unsupervised learning, primarily presented as Jupyter notebooks.

## Overview of Contents

- **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Assignments**:  
  A series of school assignments demonstrating practical applications of various machine learning techniques.

- **Segmentation Project**:  
  A real-time system project designed to segment human figures from live video streams. Segmentation is also the focus of my current thesis work, where I continue to deepen my expertise.

## Tools and Libraries

Throughout these projects, I have gained practical experience with tools and libraries such as:
- TensorFlow/Keras
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- pandas
- geopandas
- rasterio
- Pillow
- OpenCV (cv2)

I have also set up and maintain a dedicated Ubuntu server at home to handle more demanding machine learning workloads.
